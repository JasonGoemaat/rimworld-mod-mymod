<!-- ***** Cooling/Heating Information 

So my heaters and coolers have +/- 50 'energyPerSecond' and 'heatPerSecond' 
respectively.  I built a huge 50x50 internal dual-plasteel walled area
with one door.  It took 40-48 heaters to raise the internal temp
to 81c for testing with an outdoor temperature hovering around 0.
The area has a roof of course.

Something interesting happened when I created an internally 10x10
area with one wall inside.   My thought was to have the heaters
create a base-line temperature and see how my coolers worked because
heat would seep through the walls.  But without adding any coolers
the temperature inside started dropping.   I think a lot of the heat
loss is going through the roof and/or floor then.

When the temperature is -2c outside, the area equalized to 46c.  With
the outside temperature 10c, it went up to 49c.  At 12c it went up to 52c.
So it looks like this test will be impossible with changing outdoor
temperatures.  

I will have to drastically lower the target setting to get a valid test, 
or go to a desert biome, or create a heat wave somehow...

Other outdoor temps:
36 -> 61 - 25c heat going through walls, 20c escaping to outside
